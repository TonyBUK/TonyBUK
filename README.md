Welcome to my various projects.

My main focus is going to be to try and create a repository to help anyone starting out on the Advent of Code Challenge, or even perhaps someone who's just stuck and needs some guidance.

There's also various other projects here, some new, some old.

If you want to get in contact, have any suggestions etc., I've enabled discussions on my repositories, feel free to drop anything there.

  Tony.
